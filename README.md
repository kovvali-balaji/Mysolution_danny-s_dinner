Certainly! Danny’s Diner is a fascinating SQL case study that revolves around a fictional Japanese food restaurant. Let’s dive into the details:

Background:
Danny, a lover of Japanese cuisine, opens a charming little restaurant called Danny’s Diner. The menu features his three favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.

Problem Statement:
Danny seeks assistance to answer essential questions about his customers:
What are their visiting patterns?
How much money have they spent?
Which menu items are their favorites?
By understanding his customers better, Danny aims to enhance their experience and potentially expand the existing customer loyalty program.
Datasets Provided:
Danny has shared three key datasets for this case study:
Sales: Captures customer-level purchases, including order dates and product IDs.
Menu: Maps product IDs to actual product names and prices.
